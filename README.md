# CompanyRecords.API

A minimal ASP.NET Core Web API project for managing company-related data, built with .NET 9.0 with Jwt Authorization Token

## ðŸš€ Project Overview

This project sets up a lightweight API server that integrates with a local SQLite database (`company.db`). It uses ASP.NET Core's minimal hosting model and can be used as a foundation for building more complex APIs.
Build with Generic repository, AutoMapper and .Net 9
This project can grow and will not be difficult to maintain and test.
By using generic repositories we can save time since the standard methods have already been implemented, using time only to implement specific methods such as GetByIsinAsync.

Here you will find the AuthController and CompanyController.
To access the CompanyController you will need to get the Bearer Token executing the AuthController
